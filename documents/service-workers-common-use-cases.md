# Service Workers

Provide a reliable, fast, and engaging user experience that behave and feel like a native mobile applications.

## Common Use Cases

1. _Offline Caching_ **[DEMO]**: This is the most fundamental and common use case.

   How it Works: The service worker intercepts network requests and stores static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
   in the browser's cache.

2. _Handling Network Requests with Caching Strategies_ **[DEMO]**: Service workers give you fine-grained control over how
   assets are fetched.

   How it Works: Developers can define caching strategies like CacheFirst (for static assets), NetworkFirst (for fresh
   data), or StaleWhileRevalidate (for a balance of speed and freshness).

3. _Background Sync_ **[NOT CONFIGURED]**: This ensures that data is sent to the server even if the user goes offline or
   closes the application.

   How it Works: The service worker registers a request with the browser's background sync API. If the user is offline
   when they submit a form, the service worker stores the data locally and then automatically sends it to the server as
   soon as a network connection is detected.

4. _Asset Preloading_ **[PARTIALLY CONFIGURED]**: Service workers can be configured to precache a set of critical assets
   on the very first visit.

   How it Works: During the service worker's install event, it downloads and caches all specified assets.
